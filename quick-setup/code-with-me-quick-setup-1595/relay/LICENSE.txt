Introduction


These JetBrains Code With Me Terms of Use (“Terms”) describe how you can access, purchase, and use Code With Me.


Accepting these Terms creates a legal agreement between (i) JetBrains s.r.o., a company  registered in the Commercial Register of the Prague Municipal Court, Section C, File 86211, ID No. 265 02 275, with its registered office at Na hřebenech II 1718/10, Prague, 14000, Czech Republic (“JetBrains”, “us”, or “we”) and (ii) you, who are either an Organization or a natural person (“you”).




If you accept these Terms on behalf of an Organization, you confirm (‘represent and warrant’) that you are authorized to enter into agreements on behalf of that organization. If these Terms are accepted using an email address provided by a legal entity, we will regard (‘deem’) you as authorized to represent that organization. You must be able to enter into contracts (‘have capacity’).
Summary: Accepting these Terms creates an important legal agreement between you and JetBrains. There are legal consequences to accepting these Terms.
1. Definitions


   1. Special legal phrases
There are certain phrases that have an accepted meaning for lawyers. To ensure these Terms are clear and accessible, we have included the accepted ‘legal’ phrase in parentheses after the word to show that we intend it to have the accepted ‘legal’ meaning. We do this when a certain phrase is used for the first time in these Terms.

      9. Gain unauthorized access – try to gain unauthorized access to Code With Me, allow anyone else to access your or anyone else’s Guest link, including by sharing the link with anyone other than the Guest (‘third party’), or allow anyone outside of your organization to use Code With Me other than through a link you have authorized
      10. Resell – resell Code With Me or access to Code With Me to any third party
      11. Hack – utilize Code With Me, or allow Code With Me to be utilized, for the purpose of hacking, tunneling, or otherwise gaining unauthorized access to any computer or system.

3. Your Data


   6. Responsibility for Your Data
You can create or upload Your Data (see the ‘Definitions’ section) while using Code With Me. You are solely responsible for all of Your Data that you upload, link to, or otherwise make available or allow others to make available on Code With Me, regardless of the form of that Data.


You are also responsible for all legal consequences, such as claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses that result from Your Data.  We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of Your Data.


   7. Ownership of Your Data
You keep (‘retain’) ownership of, title to, and interest in Your Data.


You will only transmit or allow transmission of Data, including Third-Party Software, that you have the right to use, display, publish, and/or modify. You will fully comply with any third-party rights relating to Your Data. This means that if Your Data is licenced or copyrighted by a third-party, you must make sure you have the right to submit this Data to Code With Me and you must include any notices as required by the copyright owner or licensor.[a]


Each time you transmit, expose, use, or display something that you did not create yourself, or that you do not own the rights to, you confirm that you have the right to do so and understand that you are doing so at your own risk, and are solely responsible for this Data and all consequences of its use in Code With Me. You also indemnify us from any liability relating to this Data (see the ‘Indemnification’ section).
   8. JetBrains and your Data
We do not proactively review or screen Data and are not responsible for doing so. Nevertheless, if we deem it reasonable or necessary we have the right, but not the responsibility, to block or refuse to transmit any Data or close any Guest link running through our servers that we (‘in our sole discretion’) believe breaches these Terms, any other legal agreement with JetBrains, any other JetBrains policies, or someone else’s rights.
If you believe any Data affects (‘infringes’) your rights, you may contact us at copyright@jetbrains.com.


If you are uploading Data that you did not create or do not own, you are responsible for ensuring that you have the right to upload this Data and you give us the same right to access and use this Data in order to provide Code With Me as described in the Documentation and these Terms.
   9. Moral Rights
You keep all moral rights to all of Your Data that you upload, publish, or submit to Code With Me. This includes rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, but only so that we can do the things described in the Documentation and these Terms to provide Code With Me. If a court finds that these Terms are not enforceable under applicable law, you grant JetBrains the rights that we need to use Your Data without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations to Your Data, but only to the extent that is necessary to enable us to provide Code With Me.


Summary: Any Data created by you remains yours. However, you provide us with certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You have control over Your Data, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those necessary for us to provide Code With Me. We have the right to remove Data or close Guest links if we need to.
4. Access


   1. Your Control of Access
Depending on the nature of Your Data and the specific Code With Me feature that you are using, your Data might be visible to other Guests by default. It is your responsibility to set the appropriate level of access to Your Data, as described in the Documentation. Each Guest collects their own log, but no other storage functionality is provided by Code With Me, although you should be aware that third-party applications can be used to record Data. The Code With Me client, along with the settings chosen, persists on each Guest's machine.


   2. JetBrains’ Suspension Rights
We can immediately suspend your, or any of your Guests’, right to use Code With Me or any part of Code With Me if we have a good reason to (‘reasonably’) believe that any of the following applies:


      12. Threats – your use of Code With Me might adversely impact, or pose a security, privacy, or legal risk to JetBrains, Code With Me, or any other person (‘third party’). This also applies to your Guests’ use of Code With Me


      13. Failure to pay – you have not complied with the payment obligations in these Terms (see the “Fees and Payment” section)


      14. Financial distress – you have stopped operating in the usual course of business, have transferred (‘assigned’) your assets for the benefit of creditors or made a similar arrangement, or are undergoing bankruptcy, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution or a similar proceeding


      15. Breach of terms – you (or your Guests) otherwise breach these Terms or applicable law.


We will make reasonable efforts to notify you in the event of such suspension.


Summary: You are responsible for deciding who has access to Your Data in Code With Me. We can suspend access rights under certain circumstances.


5. Subscriptions, Fees, and Payments
   1. Subscriptions
      1. Depending on your Subscription Plan, you will have access to different features and be subject to certain limits. These features and limits are described on the JetBrains Website and/or the Subscription Confirmation and apply at the time we confirm your purchase of Code With Me or any change in your Subscription Plan, or upon installation of Code With Me. The most important limits include your Subscription Period, the number of Guest connections you (as Host) can host at one time, and the time per Guest session. For non-Enterprise versions of Code With Me, you can change your Subscription Period between monthly and yearly at any time.
      2. Upgrading Subscriptions – you can change your Subscription from one where you use Code With Me for free (a “Free Subscription”) to a Subscription You have to pay for (a “Paid Subscription”) at any time. Depending on the Subscription Plan that you select from the options JetBrains makes available, your Subscription will be either for one month or one year (“Subscription Period”). Your Subscription starts on the date in your Confirmation.
When upgrading from a Free Subscription to a Paid Subscription, your Paid Subscription will be set to the annual Subscription Period by default. For the non-Enterprise paid version of Code With Me, you can manually change your Paid Subscription from an annual to a monthly Subscription Period.
      3. Downgrading Subscriptions – you can downgrade from any Paid Subscription to a Free Subscription with fewer permitted Guests and limited time per session (“Downgrade”) at any time.
      4. Automatic Renewals – unless you explicitly opt out, your Subscription will renew automatically for another Subscription Period. We will notify you shortly before your Subscription is renewed. You can opt out of the automatic renewal of your Subscription at any time.
      5. You may be entitled to email support as described in your Subscription Confirmation.
      6. JetBrains Account – if you have a JetBrains Account, you may be able to use it to manage your personal data, as well as any licenses and subscriptions you are entitled to use. Use of the JetBrains Account is governed by the JetBrains Account Agreement, available at https://www.jetbrains.com/legal/docs/agreements/jetbrains_account.html.
Summary: Please pay attention to the time period in which you are entitled to use Code With Me, the fact that it auto-renews, and the number of Guests and session time limits you are entitled to. If you need to change these limitations, please do so in your JetBrains Account, or let us know.


   2. Subscription Fees
      1. You will be billed either monthly or annually depending on your Subscription Plan, Subscription Period, and the method by which you choose to pay. We will bill you at the beginning of the Subscription Period and at each Subscription Period renewal.
      2. Change billing period (if you are a paying user of a non-Enterprise version of Code With Me) – you can change your billing period from monthly to annual at any time, or from annual to monthly at any time, but the change will only be effective from the beginning of the next billing period.
   3. Payments
      1. Payment Terms – the JetBrains Terms and Conditions of Purchase, available at https://www.jetbrains.com/legal/docs/store/terms, apply to all fees and other amounts that you have or might have to pay (‘are payable’) relating to these Terms.
      2. Set-off – you cannot deduct or withhold (‘set off’) any amount from the fees that you have to pay to JetBrains, even if we owe you an amount or you believe we owe you an amount (‘counterclaim’), unless we agree to do so in writing.
   4. Resolution of late payments
To continue using paid versions of Code With Me without interruption, you must make sure that you pay all the relevant fees on time. Payment dates are described in your invoice. If you do not pay all fees in full and on time, we can:
      1. Limit your or a Guest’s access to Code With Me or any features in Code With Me
      2. Downgrade you to the Community (Free) Subscription plan
      3. Suspend or altogether end (‘terminate’) your access to Code With Me and terminate these Terms as described in Section 10.
You remain liable for any unpaid amounts due and must reimburse us for any additional costs that we incur in collecting late payments or if you breach anything in this Section 5.


6. Ownership


   10. We own Code With Me
We own (or have the right to use and provide to you and your Guests subject to these Terms) all the proprietary and intellectual property rights to Code With Me and to all related trade secrets, copyright, trademarks, service marks, patents, and other unregistered intellectual property. These are our rights (‘rights are reserved’). The only rights that you have in relation to Code With Me are those that are necessary in order for you and your Guests to access and use Code With Me according to the Documentation.


   11. You own Your Data
You keep ownership of all proprietary and intellectual property rights to Your Data. This means that we never own any of Your Data even though it is transmitted or created using Code With Me.


   12. Feedback
You give us the right to use, change (‘modify’), commercialize, and incorporate into Code With Me any of your ideas, suggestions, recommendations, proposals, or other feedback relating to Code With Me. You cannot withdraw this permission after it is given (‘irrevocable’) and it is perpetual. We are not required to pay a fee for this feedback (‘royalty-free’), and we can transfer and give similar rights (‘sublicense’) to your feedback to anyone else worldwide.


   13. Third-Party Software and its associated Rights
You understand that the Software integrates Third-Party Software and that by using Code With Me you might be using Third-Party Software. This Third-Party Software is provided to you on the terms and conditions of the respective Third-Party Software and you need to comply with those terms and conditions.


7. Indemnification
   14. Indemnity
If there are any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, fees, or similar expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) brought against JetBrains that arise out of, or are related to, any of the following things:


      7. Access and use of Code With Me – your access or use of Code With Me or the access or use of Code With Me by any of your Guests. This includes any actions taken by your employees and personnel in relation to Code With Me;


      8. Breach of these Terms – if you or any of your Guests breach these Terms or applicable laws;


      9. Your Data – Your Data or the combination of Your Data with other applications, Data, or processes. This includes any allegation that Your Data, or its use, development, design, production, advertising, or marketing infringes someone else’s (‘a third party’s’) rights, or that you have illegally or without permission claimed someone else’s rights;


      10. Disagreements – in the event of a disagreement between you and any of your Guests or any other third party (each of these is a “Claim”);


then you agree to indemnify, defend, and hold us and our owners, directors, employees, agents, and representatives harmless, and to indemnify, defend and hold our affiliates and their owners, directors, employees, agents, and representatives harmless, from any and all such Claims.


   15. Indemnity claims


We will promptly let you know if any of the things above happen (see the “Indemnity” section above) and someone makes a Claim. If we fail to let you know quickly, then that failure will only affect your obligation to indemnify us to the extent that our failure to inform you quickly adversely affected your ability to defend the Claim. When defending a Claim you can choose your own lawyer, with our written permission. If you have our written approval, you can resolve (‘settle’) the claim as you decide (‘at your discretion’). However, we can take control of the defence and settlement at any time.

These Terms are governed by the laws of the Czech Republic, without reference to conflict of laws principles, and specifically excluding the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. The parties to the agreement constituted by these Terms undertake to use best commercial efforts to amicably settle any disputes arising hereunder (“Dispute”).


Should the parties to the agreement constituted by these Terms fail to settle a Dispute amicably, the Dispute will be excluded from the jurisdiction of general courts and all such Disputes will be finally decided by the Arbitration Court attached to the Czech Chamber of Commerce and the Agricultural Chamber of the Czech Republic by three arbitrators in accordance with the Rules of that Arbitration Court, and the language of the proceedings will be English; provided that if you are a consumer, you and JetBrains agree that any Dispute-related litigation may only be brought in, and shall be subject to the jurisdiction of, any competent court of the Czech Republic, unless provided otherwise by applicable consumer law. Consumer Disputes can also be settled out of court through the Czech Trade Inspection Authority (www.coi.cz) or the European Commission online platform for dispute resolution (http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr).


   7. Force Majeure
We will not be responsible (‘liable’) for any delay or failure to perform any obligation under these Terms where the delay or failure results from any cause beyond our reasonable control. This includes any ‘acts of God’, labor disputes or other industrial disturbances, systemic electrical, telecommunications or other utility failures, public health emergencies, earthquakes, storms or other elements of nature, blockages, embargoes, riots, acts or orders of government, acts of terrorism, or war.


   8. Severability
If a court finds that any part of, or word in, these Terms is not enforceable, that part or word will not affect the enforceability of the rest of these Terms.


   9. Interpretation
Any heading, title, or paragraph summary is only for your convenience and does not affect interpretation of these Terms. Any reference to an inclusive word, such as ‘including’, is not comprehensive and refers to other items in that category. References to time or periods of time are determined in reference to Central European Time.


   10. Waiver
Any waiver of our rights under these Terms must be in writing and signed by us.
